UNO Classic Game Rules:
 
Welcome to UNO Classic Game! Compete in a 1v1 battle where the objective is to be the first player to remove all their cards. 
To start, you can choose whether to compete for 500 points, 1000 points, 2000 points, or relentlessly 
(until one player chooses to not play again). Please be sure that CAPS LOCK are ON to ensure that input can be processed 
and to progress with the game. Afterwards, each player will begin with 7 cards, and try to be the first one to remove all their cards.
Type P to play a card(provided you can play a card legally), D to draw a card, or U to type UNO when your turn arrives. 
Please note that you MUST type U to shout UNO when you are about to remove your second to last card, as the system will end up 
catching you otherwise and force you to draw 2 cards. Each card will be splitted into the following categories:

     1. Number cards (0-9)
 
     2. Action cards (DRAW2, SKIP, REVERSE)
 
     3. Wild cards (WILD, DRAW4WILD)
 
     DRAW2 will force the next player to draw 2 cards and loses their turn

     SKIP will force the next player to lose their turn

     REVERSE will reverse gameplay

     WILD card will allow you to choose the color of the card

     DRAW4WILD is the same as a WILD, BUT will make next player draw 4
     if they do not challenge. If they do challenge and are successful,
     the player of draw 4 will draw instead, if unsuccessful, draw 6 cards.
 
 Points distribution:
     1. Number cards are worth their face values each (0 for 0 points, 1 for 1 point, ... ,9 for 9 points)
     2. Action cards (REVERSE, DRAW2, SKIP) are worth 20 points each
     3. WILD cards (traditional wilds and wild +4s) are worth 50 points each
